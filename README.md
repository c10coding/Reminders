# Reminders
This is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to make your own custom reminders that show at whatever time interval you want!

# Plugman
We strongly recommend that you download this plugin. Every time you do /reminders settime, you're required to restart the server or reload the plugin to have the changes take effect. You can either do this by restarting your server, or using the plugin [Plugman](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/plugman). Once you download this, you can reload a specific plugin by doing /plugman reload (Plugin)

# Help
If you need help, you can either do /reminders help and it'll give you a list of the commands within the plugin or you can contact me via email: c10.coding@gmail.com.
